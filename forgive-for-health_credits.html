Forgiveness and Conflict:
Conflict resolution is integral to a successful relationship and resentment
engendered by partner transgressions is likely to fuel couple conflict and
impede successful conflict resolution. In contrast, forgiving the partner for the
transgression is one potential means of providing closure with regard to
a painful or disturbing relationship event. Forgiveness may therefore have
substantial implications for long-term relationship outcomes as well as short-
term patterns of interaction.

<br/>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgiveness" title="Wikipedia Forgiveness" target="_blank" >Wikipedia Forgiveness</a>
Studies show that people who forgive are happier and healthier than those who hold resentments. The first study to look at how forgiveness improves physical health discovered that when people think about forgiving an offender it leads to improved functioning in their cardiovascular and nervous systems. Another study at the University of Wisconsin found the more forgiving people were, the less they suffered from a wide range of illnesses. The less forgiving people reported a greater number of health problems.
